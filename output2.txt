If you do something with passion, you will never 
look at your watch but if you are doing something with pressure, you will never forget to look at your watch.
Passion releases good chemicals in your body and pRessure do the opposite. 
Anxiety is the by product of pressure and happiness is the by product of passion.
CHOICE IS YOURS!!! How you want to proceed for any work>
